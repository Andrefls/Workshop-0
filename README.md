Task 0
After the first class on this course, I wanted to create a simplified sunset and sunrise. Something methaforic. 
So, I reserched the circle code inputs and follow the class and workshop 0 video
At the begginig creating the shapes was easy, however, frustration started to appear when the animation did not look as I wanted.
I used https://p5js.org/reference/ to get the codes for the shapes.
I used www.google.com to ask about a way to code a transformation, However, at this stage those codes seems to be complex for me.
A problem that I found was to make the circle drop down in the canvas at the speed I wanted to go, at the end I had to use try and error to be able to succeed.
I extracted some basic knowledge from the lecture videos at https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967
I would like to learn to make transformation, and also how to indicate p5.js to do an action with simple codes.
At the end, I got a bit close to the animation I wanted, however,there is alot to improve. Speed, movement and transformations.
